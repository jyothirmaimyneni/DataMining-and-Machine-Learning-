# DataMining-and-Machine-Learning-
In this project, five different machine learn-ing techniques are performed on three data sets. The five techniques are XG-Boost, Ran-dom Forest, Lasso regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). KNN and SVM are used for clas-sification of the bank marketing data set, while XG-Boost, Random Forest and Lasso regression are used for regression among the car prices and real estate price prediction data sets. For regression models, evaluation methods like Root Mean Square error (RMSE) and R squared are used to check the quality of prediction. The evaluating method used for classification models is Confusion Matrix (CFM) , and F1- score is also used in the KNN model for measuring the accuracy of the model performed on the data set. Model tuning is done on the models to attain good accuracy in predicting the prices of the data sets. Classification on the other hand, is per-formed to itâ€™s best to classify the data into different categories.
